/**
 * Ambient Effects - Subtle visual enhancements for the meditation scene
 *
 * These effects add depth and interest near the globe and orbiting shards
 * without being distracting. All effects are breath-synchronized.
 *
 * Components:
 * - OrbitRings: Ethereal concentric rings showing orbital paths
 * - EnergyMotes: Tiny glowing particles drifting near shards
 * - LightBeams: Soft radiant beams emanating from the globe
 * - FloatingGeometry: Small geometric shapes orbiting lazily
